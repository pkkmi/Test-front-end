# OAuth Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Configuration

The application is currently configured to use the following OAuth settings:

- **Production URL**: https://web-production-c1f4.up.railway.app
- **OAuth Callback URL**: https://web-production-c1f4.up.railway.app/callback
- **Google Client ID**: 934412857118-i13t5ma9afueo40tmohosprsjf4555f0.apps.googleusercontent.com

## How to Test the Fix

1. Deploy the latest changes to your Railway app
2. Clear your browser cookies and cache
3. Visit https://web-production-c1f4.up.railway.app
4. Click on "Login" 
5. You should now be able to sign in with Google without getting the redirect_uri_mismatch error

## What Was Changed

We've updated the OAuth implementation to:

1. Hard-code the correct callback URL (`https://web-production-c1f4.up.railway.app/callback`) directly in the code
2. Bypass the dynamic URL generation that was causing issues
3. Add better error logging to identify future issues

## If You Still See Errors

1. Check the Railway logs for any error messages
2. Verify that the callback URL in Google Cloud Console exactly matches:
   - `https://web-production-c1f4.up.railway.app/callback`
3. Make sure there are no typos, extra slashes, or protocol differences

## Important Note

Google OAuth may take up to 5 minutes to reflect changes made in the Google Cloud Console. If you've just updated settings there, wait a few minutes before testing again.
